# Modern Modoki

Bringing back the Modern Modoki theme into the post-theme era. **This theme supports Firefox 89+**.

![Firefox screenshot running Modern Modoki](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11209477/192164979-31f7c725-87c4-4513-aaed-d2c52a17a9b6.png)

This project aims to bring the Modern Modoki (or close in appearance) theme back to Firefox using the amazing Redmond Firefox theme base, via Firefox's remaining UserChrome interface.

If you're using Pale Moon browser, Use **[Modoki Moon][mmm]** instead of this - a full fork of the original.

If you want compact density in Proton, set `browser.uidensity` to `1` ([source](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/06/firefox-89-released-with-brand-new-look)).

## Bugs & Limitations

* MacOS is **not supported**. **Linux** and **Windows** is supported.
  * This theme is primarily tested on **XFCE** with **[Chicago95][c95]** theme. Other setups may encounter bugs.
* This theme is **not compatible** with Firefox skins/themes, or a combined title bar.
* Dark mode is not currently supported.
  * on a PC set to dark mode, change the theme to light in Firefox Customise setting.
* The menu bar is expected to be visible. The bookmarks bar is optional.
* Due to the current reliance on low-res button images, this theme will look incredibly blurry on screen densities above 1080p.
* Like the original Modern Modoki, not all icons are covered - especially not extensions.

**If you experience graphical oddities please submit a bug report with screenshots + OS version.**

## Installation

Note: These theme is **not supported on MacOS**. 

* (Windows & Linux) In Customize, turn on Title Bar and enable Menu bar under toolbars.
* Download a zip copy of the theme (preferably from releases).
* In Firefox, navigate to `about:support`.
* Under 'Profile Directory', click on Open Directory.
* In this folder, drop the `chrome` folder from the theme here.
* In Firefox again, navigate to `about:config`.
* Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set to true.
* Restart Firefox.

If done correctly, you Firefox will now be skinned with Modern Modoki. **Please note this theme will not be included in synchronise**.
