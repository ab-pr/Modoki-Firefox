This project aims to bring the Modern Modoki (or close in appearance) theme back to Firefox using the amazing Redmond Firefox theme base, via Firefox's remaining UserChrome interface.

If you're using Pale Moon browser, there's a fork of the original extension which is the best way to use Modern Modoki.

## Plans
Nowadays Firefox button icons are vectors, and generally of a single colour. This allows the current approach to theming to work. My plan is to make a vector background of the familiar circular and square Modoki icons. This would then mean we can keep the original Firefox icons, but have them appear native.

Feel free to suggest further Netscape or Modoki like adjustments in the Issues segment, or fork your own and run with it.

## Bugs
* This theme expects the menu to be visible. It should work regardless, but might look strange.
* Removing the titlebar might cause unpredictable side-effects.
* A lot of functionality was made since Netscape and Modoki. I've added icons where relevant, but original icons will show through until I create a new icon pack.
* This theme will look incredibly blurry on screen densities above 1080p.
* Using Firefox 'themes' will cause the theme to go very strange.

## Installation
* Download a zip copy of the theme (preferably from releases).
* In Firefox, navigate to `about:support`.
* Under 'Profile Directory', click on Open Directory.
* In this folder, drop the `chrome` folder from the theme here.
* In Firefox again, navigate to `about:config`.
* Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set to true.
* Restart Firefox.

If done correctly, you Firefox will now be skinned with Modern Modoki. **Please note this theme will not be included in synchronise**.
